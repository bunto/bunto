Hey there! We have a important update of Bunto for you to enjoy this year.
Packed full of bug fixes as usual, thanks to the tireless efforts of our
exceptional Bunto community. Three changes to call out:

1. If you're a big fan of [`where_by_exp`](/docs/filters/), you'll be an
even bigger fan of [`group_by_exp`](/docs/filters/).
2. Using a custom timezone in Bunto on Windows? Yeah, sorry that hasn't ever worked
   properly. We made it possible to accurately [set the timezone using IANA
   timezone codes](https://buntowaf.tk/docs/windows/#timezone-management).
3. Documentation has been improved, notably on themes, includes and permalinks.

And [lots and lots more!](/docs/history/#v3-4-5)

This update was made possible by the dedicated efforts of our excellent
contributors.

As always, if you encounter bugs, please do [search the issues]({{ site.repository }}/issues)
and [file an issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) if you aren't able to
find a resolution. We also have [our Bunto Talk
forum](https://talk.buntowaf.tk) for those of you with general questions
about how to accomplish certain tasks with Bunto.

Happy Buntoing!
