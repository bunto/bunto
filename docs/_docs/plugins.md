Bunto has a plugin system with hooks that allow you to create custom generated
content specific to your site. You can run custom code for your site without
having to modify the Bunto source itself.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Plugins on GitHub Pages</h5>
  <p>
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is powered by Bunto.
    However, all Pages sites are generated using the <code>--safe</code> option
    to disable custom plugins for security reasons. Unfortunately, this means
    your plugins won’t work if you’re deploying to GitHub Pages.<br><br>
    You can still use GitHub Pages to publish your site, but you’ll need to
    convert the site locally and push the generated static files to your GitHub
    repository instead of the Bunto source files.
  </p>
</div>

## Installing a plugin

You have 3 options for installing plugins:

1. In your site source root, make a `_plugins` directory. Place your plugins
here. Any file ending in `*.rb` inside this directory will be loaded before
Bunto generates your site.
2. In your `_config.yml` file, add a new array with the key `gems` and the
values of the gem names of the plugins you'd like to use. An example:


        gems: [bunto-coffeescript, bunto-watch, bunto-assets]
        # This will require each of these gems automatically.

    Then install your plugins using `gem install bunto-coffeescript bunto-watch bunto-assets`

3. Add the relevant plugins to a Bundler group in your `Gemfile`. An
    example:

        group :bunto_plugins do
          gem "my-bunto-plugin"
          gem "another-bunto-plugin"
        end

    Now you need to install all plugins from your Bundler group by running single command `bundle install`


<div class="note info">
  <h5>
    <code>_plugins</code>, <code>_config.yml</code> and <code>Gemfile</code>
    can be used simultaneously
  </h5>
  <p>
    You may use any of the aforementioned plugin options simultaneously in the
    same site if you so choose. Use of one does not restrict the use of the
    others.
  </p>
</div>

In general, plugins you make will fall into one of five categories:

1. [Generators](#generators)
2. [Converters](#converters)
3. [Commands](#commands)
4. [Tags](#tags)
5. [Hooks](#hooks)

## Generators

You can create a generator when you need Bunto to create additional content
based on your own rules.

A generator is a subclass of `Bunto::Generator` that defines a `generate`
method, which receives an instance of
[`Bunto::Site`]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/lib/bunto/site.rb). The
return value of `generate` is ignored.

Generators run after Bunto has made an inventory of the existing content, and
before the site is generated. Pages with YAML Front Matters are stored as
instances of
[`Bunto::Page`]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/lib/bunto/page.rb)
and are available via `site.pages`. Static files become instances of
[`Bunto::StaticFile`]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/lib/bunto/static_file.rb)
and are available via `site.static_files`. See
[the Variables documentation page](/docs/variables/) and
[`Bunto::Site`]({{ site.repository }}/blob/master/lib/bunto/site.rb)
for more details.

For instance, a generator can inject values computed at build time for template
variables. In the following example the template `reading.html` has two
variables `ongoing` and `done` that we fill in the generator:

```ruby
module Reading
  class Generator < Bunto::Generator
    def generate(site)
      ongoing, done = Book.all.partition(&:ongoing?)

      reading = site.pages.detect {|page| page.name == 'reading.html'}
      reading.data['ongoing'] = ongoing
      reading.data['done'] = done
    end
  end
end
```

This is a more complex generator that generates new pages:

```ruby
module Bunto

  class CategoryPage < Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, category)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'

      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'category_index.html')
      self.data['category'] = category

      category_title_prefix = site.config['category_title_prefix'] || 'Category: '
      self.data['title'] = "#{category_title_prefix}#{category}"
    end
  end

  class CategoryPageGenerator < Generator
    safe true

    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? 'category_index'
        dir = site.config['category_dir'] || 'categories'
        site.categories.each_key do |category|
          site.pages << CategoryPage.new(site, site.source, File.join(dir, category), category)
        end
      end
    end
  end

end
```

In this example, our generator will create a series of files under the
`categories` directory for each category, listing the posts in each category
using the `category_index.html` layout.

Generators are only required to implement one method:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>generate</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Generates content as a side-effect.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## Converters

If you have a new markup language you’d like to use with your site, you can
include it by implementing your own converter. Both the Markdown and
[Textile](https://github.com/bunto/bunto-textile-converter) markup
languages are implemented using this method.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Remember your YAML Front Matter</h5>
  <p>
    Bunto will only convert files that have a YAML header at the top, even for
    converters you add using a plugin.
  </p>
</div>

Below is a converter that will take all posts ending in `.upcase` and process
them using the `UpcaseConverter`:

```ruby
module Bunto
  class UpcaseConverter < Converter
    safe true
    priority :low

    def matches(ext)
      ext =~ /^\.upcase$/i
    end

    def output_ext(ext)
      ".html"
    end

    def convert(content)
      content.upcase
    end
  end
end
```

Converters should implement at a minimum 3 methods:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>matches</code></p>
      </td>
      <td><p>
        Does the given extension match this converter’s list of acceptable
        extensions? Takes one argument: the file’s extension (including the
        dot). Must return <code>true</code> if it matches, <code>false</code>
        otherwise.
      </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>output_ext</code></p>
      </td>
      <td><p>
        The extension to be given to the output file (including the dot).
        Usually this will be <code>".html"</code>.
      </p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>convert</code></p>
      </td>
      <td><p>
        Logic to do the content conversion. Takes one argument: the raw content
        of the file (without YAML Front Matter). Must return a String.
      </p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

In our example, `UpcaseConverter#matches` checks if our filename extension is
`.upcase`, and will render using the converter if it is. It will call
`UpcaseConverter#convert` to process the content. In our simple converter we’re
simply uppercasing the entire content string. Finally, when it saves the page,
it will do so with a `.html` extension.

## Commands

As of version 2.5.0, Bunto can be extended with plugins which provide
subcommands for the `bunto` executable. This is possible by including the
relevant plugins in a `Gemfile` group called `:bunto_plugins`:

```ruby
group :bunto_plugins do
  gem "my_fancy_bunto_plugin"
end
```

Each `Command` must be a subclass of the `Bunto::Command` class and must
contain one class method: `init_with_program`. An example:

```ruby
class MyNewCommand < Bunto::Command
  class << self
    def init_with_program(prog)
      prog.command(:new) do |c|
        c.syntax "new [options]"
        c.description 'Create a new Bunto site.'

        c.option 'dest', '-d DEST', 'Where the site should go.'

        c.action do |args, options|
          Bunto::Site.new_site_at(options['dest'])
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Commands should implement this single class method:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>init_with_program</code></p>
      </td>
      <td><p>
        This method accepts one parameter, the
        <code><a href="https://github.com/bunto/mercenary#readme">Mercenary::Program</a></code>
        instance, which is the Bunto program itself. Upon the program,
        commands may be created using the above syntax. For more details,
        visit the Mercenary repository on GitHub.com.
      </p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## Tags

If you’d like to include custom liquid tags in your site, you can do so by
hooking into the tagging system. Built-in examples added by Bunto include the
`highlight` and `include` tags. Below is an example of a custom liquid tag that
will output the time the page was rendered:

```ruby
module Bunto
  class RenderTimeTag < Liquid::Tag

    def initialize(tag_name, text, tokens)
      super
      @text = text
    end

    def render(context)
      "#{@text} #{Time.now}"
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_tag('render_time', Bunto::RenderTimeTag)
```

At a minimum, liquid tags must implement:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>render</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Outputs the content of the tag.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

You must also register the custom tag with the Liquid template engine as
follows:

```ruby
Liquid::Template.register_tag('render_time', Bunto::RenderTimeTag)
```

In the example above, we can place the following tag anywhere in one of our
pages:

```ruby
{% raw %}
<p>{% render_time page rendered at: %}</p>
{% endraw %}
```

And we would get something like this on the page:

```html
<p>page rendered at: Tue June 22 23:38:47 –0500 2010</p>
```

### Liquid filters

You can add your own filters to the Liquid template system much like you can
add tags above. Filters are simply modules that export their methods to liquid.
All methods will have to take at least one parameter which represents the input
of the filter. The return value will be the output of the filter.

```ruby
module Bunto
  module AssetFilter
    def asset_url(input)
      "http://www.example.com/#{input}?#{Time.now.to_i}"
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_filter(Bunto::AssetFilter)
```

<div class="note">
  <h5>ProTip™: Access the site object using Liquid</h5>
  <p>
    Bunto lets you access the <code>site</code> object through the
    <code>context.registers</code> feature of Liquid at <code>context.registers[:site]</code>. For example, you can
    access the global configuration file <code>_config.yml</code> using
    <code>context.registers[:site].config</code>.
  </p>
</div>

### Flags

There are two flags to be aware of when writing a plugin:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>safe</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          A boolean flag that informs Bunto whether this plugin may be safely
          executed in an environment where arbitrary code execution is not
          allowed. This is used by GitHub Pages to determine which core plugins
          may be used, and which are unsafe to run. If your plugin does not
          allow for arbitrary code execution, set this to <code>true</code>.
          GitHub Pages still won’t load your plugin, but if you submit it for
          inclusion in core, it’s best for this to be correct!
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>priority</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          This flag determines what order the plugin is loaded in. Valid values
          are: <code>:lowest</code>, <code>:low</code>, <code>:normal</code>,
          <code>:high</code>, and <code>:highest</code>. Highest priority
          matches are applied first, lowest priority are applied last.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

To use one of the example plugins above as an illustration, here is how you’d
specify these two flags:

```ruby
module Bunto
  class UpcaseConverter < Converter
    safe true
    priority :low
    ...
  end
end
```

## Hooks

Using hooks, your plugin can exercise fine-grained control over various aspects
of the build process. If your plugin defines any hooks, Bunto will call them
at pre-defined points.

Hooks are registered to a container and an event name. To register one, you
call Bunto::Hooks.register, and pass the container, event name, and code to
call whenever the hook is triggered. For example, if you want to execute some
custom functionality every time Bunto renders a post, you could register a
hook like this:

```ruby
Bunto::Hooks.register :posts, :post_render do |post|
  # code to call after Bunto renders a post
end
```

Bunto provides hooks for <code>:site</code>, <code>:pages</code>,
<code>:posts</code>, and <code>:documents</code>. In all cases, Bunto calls
your hooks with the container object as the first callback parameter. However,
all `:pre_render` hooks and the`:site, :post_render` hook will also provide a
payload hash as a second parameter. In the case of `:pre_render`, the payload
gives you full control over the variables that are available while rendering.
In the case of `:site, :post_render`, the payload contains final values after
rendering all the site (useful for sitemaps, feeds, etc).

The complete list of available hooks is below:

<div class="mobile-side-scroller">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Container</th>
      <th>Event</th>
      <th>Called</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>:site</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p><code>:after_init</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Just after the site initializes, but before setup & render. Good
        for modifying the configuration of the site.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>:site</code></p>
      </td>

- [vim-bunto](https://github.com/parkr/vim-bunto): A vim plugin to generate
  new posts and run `bunto build` all without leaving vim.
- [markdown-writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer): An Atom package for Bunto. It can create new posts/drafts, manage tags/categories, insert link/images and add many useful key mappings.
- [Wordpress2Bunto](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2bunto/): A Wordpress plugin that allows you to use Wordpress as your editor and (automatically) export content in to Bunto. WordPress2Bunto attempts to marry these two systems together in order to make a site that can be easily managed from all devices.
