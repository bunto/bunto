Bunto is a Web Application Framework and can be used as a static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Bunto takes your content, renders HTML and CSS templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, hostSE, Nginx or another web server. Bunto is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

## Philosophy

Bunto does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Bunto gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

## Getting Started

Bunto will work on most systems out-of-the-box. You need only to install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) on your system.
After that run in your command line program this command:

``` bash
gem install bunto
```

* [Install](https://bunto.github.io/docs/installation/) the gem
* Read up about its [Usage](https://bunto.github.io/docs/usage/) and [Configuration](https://bunto.github.io/docs/configuration/)
* Take a gander at some existing [Sites](https://wiki.github.com/bunto/bunto/sites)
* [Fork](https://github.com/bunto/bunto/fork) and [Contribute](https://bunto.github.io/docs/contributing/) your own modifications
* Have questions? Check out our official forum community [Bunto Talk](https://bunto.github.io/talk/) or [`#bunto` on irc.freenode.net](https://botbot.me/freenode/bunto/)
