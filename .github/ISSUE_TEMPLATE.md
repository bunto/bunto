<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a bug with Bunto. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. You can convert `[ ]` into `[x]` to check boxes (or submit
  and check.) If there is no need for certain fields like output and redirection, please delete
  those headers before submitting. We know not all tickets require those steps.
  Otherwise, please try to be as detailed as possible.

  If you are unsure this is a bug in Bunto, or this is a bug caused
  by a plugin that isn't directly related to Bunto, or if this is just
  a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at
  https://talk.buntowaf.tk where non-bug questions go.

  Please make sure to mention an affinity team whose responsibilities
  most closely align with your issue.

  Thanks!

  Ubuntu much, please check the parent distro. Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Lubuntu should
  also be flagged as Ubuntu as their packages come from upstream Ubuntu.

## My Reproduction Steps

<!--
  If this error occured on GitHub Pages, please try to provide us with logs,
  and look at them yourself, to determine if this is an actual Bunto bug. In
  the event you are unsure, file a ticket, however, when you do please provide
  the logs (strip them of personal information.)

  If you have trouble finding your logs, please email support@github.com and
  they will happily help you. If you cannot find logs, please try your best to
  replicate it locally because we cannot fix a problem if we do not know
  exactly what caused it, or within a relatively close distance.
-->

<!--
  Insert the steps you took to for this problem to exist. Such as the
  directories you created and, the full command you ran, and include any
  plugins you have installed, this is very important.

  If your steps are complicated, you can also submit a GitHub
  repository (please no zips, they will be removed and rejected by maintainers,)
  and just supply a command for us to reproduce it ourselves.
-->

## The Output I Wanted

<!--
  Insert the output from the command. Alter it as little as you can.
  The minimum should be personal information. Though we normally don't log
  anything like that so there should be no need to alter it.
